MyVariabilityModelingFramework
==============================
MVMF stands for Miao's Variability Modeling Framework. It contains the tools that I developed during my Ph.D. study.

It includes some reverse engineering such as MyNLP which is an example for processing nature language from documentation, and my plugins (on Eclipse, MagicDraw) for supporting model-driven development or code generation.

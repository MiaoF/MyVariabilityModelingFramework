MyVariabilityModelingFramework
==============================
MVMF stands for Miao's Variabilitz Modeling Framework. It contains the tools that I developed during my Ph.D. Study.

It includes some reverse engineering such as MyNLP, and my plugins (on Eclipse, MagicDraw) for supporting model-driven development or code generation.
